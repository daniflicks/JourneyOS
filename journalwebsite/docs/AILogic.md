AI Logic:

1. Fetch Claude response when a user puts an input
2. Refetch Claude response when user changes input
3. Save Claude response, and keep in displayed in UI on refresh, forward and back navigation
4. Save to long term memory for later reference (can be implemented later when a backend is built) 


AI chat logic:

- Save chat conversations to the backend by embedding chats
- AI can remeber saved user answers through the exersizes and guide them based on that info if relevant
- Be able to work with calendar and schedule things and be aware of when the user has what planned. So for example if the user asks do I have time to go get my nails done on Sunday, AI assistant can look at the users calendar in app/calendar and see what is scheduled and advise if its possible or not.
- Be customizable (maybe later on. Like have unique voice to choose from, etc)
