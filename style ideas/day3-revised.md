# DAY 3

## PAGE 1: MORNING OPENER
"Between what happened and what we fear will happen again lies a world of possibility."

**Today's Journey: The Catastrophizing Reality Check**
Today we'll explore how our minds magnify past experiences into future catastrophes. When something difficult happens, our brains often create an even scarier version for the future. We'll learn to see the difference between what actually happened and the horror movie our mind creates.

**Mini Check-In:**
□ Noticing your mind jump to worst-case scenarios  
□ Feeling like past pain guarantees future pain  
□ Adding layers of "what if" to real experiences  
□ Believing the next time will be even worse  
□ Avoiding situations because of amplified memories

**Part 1: Understanding Your Mind's Magnification (10 minutes)**

When we experience something painful, our protective brain does three things:
1. **Amplifies** - Makes it seem bigger than it was
2. **Generalizes** - Assumes it will happen everywhere
3. **Projects** - Creates an even worse future version

**Your Catastrophizing Check:**
Think of a past difficult experience related to your project fears.

**Spot the Magnification:**
Circle words/phrases that show catastrophizing:
- "Always" / "Never" / "Everyone" / "No one"
- "Completely destroyed" / "Total failure" / "Ruined everything"
- "Can't recover" / "End of the world" / "Worst thing ever"

## PAGE 3: REALITY ANCHORING

**Part 1: The Survival Inventory**
Yes, difficult things happened. But let's acknowledge what else is true:

**From Your Past Experience:**
- I survived by: [Space for writing]
- I'm still here, which means: [Space for writing]
- Skills I gained from handling it: [Space for writing]
- Support that appeared: [Space for writing]
- What didn't happen (that I feared would): [Space for writing]

**Part 2: The Catastrophe Scale**
Rate your current project fears:

| My Catastrophic Fear | Reality Scale 1-10 | Survival Likelihood % |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Example: "I'll be homeless" | 2 (very unlikely) | 98% (I have resources) |
| [Your fear] | [Reality rating] | [Survival %] |
| [Your fear] | [Reality rating] | [Survival %] |
| [Your fear] | [Reality rating] | [Survival %] |

**The Power Questions:**
- If this happened, what would I actually do first?
- Who would I call?
- What resources do I have now that I didn't have before?
- What's the most boring (non-catastrophic) version of this outcome?

**Tomorrow's Preview:** Tomorrow we'll listen closely to your inner critic and learn to distinguish its voice from reality.

**Emergency Support Box: When Catastrophizing Takes Over**
- Name it: "This is catastrophizing, not predicting"
- Ground yourself: Name 5 things you can see right now
- Reality check: What would you tell a friend thinking this?
- Remember: Your mind is trying to protect you by overreacting
- Breathe: Catastrophic thoughts need shallow breathing to thrive
- Ask: "What's the most likely outcome?" not "What's the worst?"
